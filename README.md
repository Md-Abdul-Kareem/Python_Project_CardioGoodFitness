# Cardio Good Fitness - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

This project explores customer purchasing behavior for a fitness equipment company using Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) techniques in Python.

The dataset contains demographic and product usage data for customers who purchased different treadmill models. Through data analysis and visualization, we uncover insights into customer profiles, product trends, and potential marketing strategies.

## Project Objectives

- Understand the distribution of treadmill models and their popularity

- Analyze customer demographics such as age, gender, income, and education

- Discover usage trends and how they relate to product preferences

- Profile customer segments based on their buying behavior

- Generate actionable business recommendations for targeted marketing

## Technologies Used

**Python**

- pandas

- numpy

- matplotlib

- seaborn

- **Jupyter Notebook**

## Key Findings

- TM195 is the most purchased treadmill model, popular among middle-aged, higher-income customers

- TM798 appeals to younger customers with high usage frequency

- Income and education levels strongly influence product choice

- Weekly usage and miles run vary significantly by customer type

## Deliverables

- Clean and structured Jupyter Notebook with 15 business questions answered
